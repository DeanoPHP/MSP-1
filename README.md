## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- Animate.css
- FontAwesome
- Google Fonts

## Design

### Color Palette
  - Gold: #C7A64A - Used for h1 tags and logo;
  - Dark shade of yellow-green #5C501F - Used for sub-headings;
  - Light grey: #fafafa - Used for links;
  - very light grey: #eeeeee - used for body;

## Font Usage

Our project utilizes a combination of FontAwesome, Roboto, and Anonymous Pro to ensure clear readability, aesthetic appeal, and functional design across all elements of our website.

### Fonts Details

- **Google Fonts**: Used primarily for icons across the website. FontAwesome provides scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.

- **Roboto**: This is the primary typeface used for text elements on the website. Designed for readability, Roboto offers a modern, neutral look with a wide range of weights and styles.

- **Anonymous Pro**: Employed mainly in code snippets and data displays, Anonymous Pro is a monospace font that offers excellent clarity and readability in technical sections of the website.

### Font Integration

To integrate and use these fonts in your development environment, follow these steps:

- **fonts.google.com**:
  ```css
    /* Importing Roboto font with all weights and styles */
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto:ital,wght@0,100..900;1,100..900&display=swap');

    /* Importing Anonymous Pro font with specific weights and styles */
    @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Anonymous+Pro:ital,wght@0,400;0,700;1,400;1,700&display=swap');

- [Link for Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/?query=roboto)
- [Link for Anonymous Pro](https://fonts.google.com/?query=anonymous+pro)


Anonymous Pro and Roboto make a highly functional pairing in digital design, combining clarity with versatility. Anonymous Pro, a monospaced font, offers exceptional readability for code snippets and data, ensuring that each character is distinctly spaced and easy to differentiate. This makes it ideal for technical contexts where precision in text presentation is crucial. Roboto, on the other hand, is a sans-serif font known for its clean lines and friendly appearance, making it suitable for more general text such as paragraphs, headings, and user interfaces. Together, these fonts provide a balanced aesthetic: Roboto enhances the visual appeal and ease of reading for narrative text, while Anonymous Pro ensures technical sections are approachable and clear. This combination is particularly effective in environments like technical blogs, programming interfaces, or any application where text clarity and user comfort are paramount.

### Implementation

Here is an example of how to apply colours and fonts:

```css
:root {
    --link-font-color: #fafafa;
    --gold-color: #C7A64A;
    --sub-heading-color: #5C501F;
    --font-family-body: "Roboto", sans-serif;
    --h1-font-family: "Anonymous Pro", sans-serif;
}

.navbar-brand {
    font-family: var(--h1-font-family);
    color: var(--gold-color);
}
```

## Assistance from AI
During the development of this project, AI-powered tools were utilized to assist with certain aspects, including the design and implementation of a transparent navbar using Bootstrap. This assistance helped to optimize the solution and implement best practices in web development.

### Specific AI Contributions
- **Bootstrap Navbar Transparency**: AI provided guidance on how to adjust the `background-color` property using RGBA values to achieve the desired level of transparency in the navbar.
